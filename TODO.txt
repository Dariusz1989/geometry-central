Things to not forget about:

- Destruction order of MeshData and halfedge mesh. Can we support either being destructed first? Current MeshData must die first (I think). If not, add note to docs.

- #defines to manage safety checks. Docs mention NGC_SAFETY_CHECKS.

- Seems to be no reason we can't re-use delete elements for future allocations. This will reduce sparsification (though invalidate the property that iteration works through insertion)
